### 🧠 About Me

I'm a pragmatic and curious developer on the path to mastering full-stack development.  
Currently focused on building small React projects and exploring backend fundamentals with Node.js.  
I care deeply about clean architecture, maintainable code, and bilingual documentation (English/Persian) for global accessibility.
